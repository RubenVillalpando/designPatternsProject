# The +LambdaHandlerTemplate+ is an implementation of the {Template Method}[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern].
# It allows you to create instances of various ::LambdaHandler classes.
# Each one with the same logic starting with the ::handle_request, 
# just overriding methods that the implementation will accept.
